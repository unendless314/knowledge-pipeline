# IS THIS THE LOW

[00:00] what's up traders welcome back to trade talk where we cut through the noise and talk real market moves
 last week bitcoin was getting absolutely hammered we're talking massive volume spikes prices dipping
 into levels not seen since late 2024 the fear and greed index screaming extreme fear hitting lows
 like we saw in 2022 is this the capitulation we've been waiting for the kind of washout that marks a
 major low and sets up the next leg higher or are we staring down something uglier like what happened
 when exchanges started collapsing back in 2022 today we're breaking it all down the capitulation
 style volumes that we're seeing right now why this feels eerily similar to 2022 but with some big
 differences the rising bip 110 node adoption that's still a wild card risk and a few technical levels
 to watch stick around this could be a pivotal moment wash out that like button if you're writing this
 volatility with me and let's dive in first let's talk about the elephant in the room volume we've
 seen explosive capitulation style selling pressure in early february specifically the 5th and 6th bitcoin
 plunged over 15 percent in a single day the worst since the ftx mess in november 2022 realized losses hit
 record levels with billions in forced liquidations cascading through futures markets short-term holders
 are dumping at massive losses funding rates flipped deeply negative and on-chain metrics like the
 capitulation spike from glass node printed the second largest in two years trading volume exploded as panic
 hit this is classic everyone who is going to sell has sold territory historically these extreme volume
 flush outs especially when combined with fear at rock bottom levels often mark local or even cycle
 lows think about it weak hands capitulate supply gets absorbed by stronger players and the market resets
 for the next move up we're seeing hallmarks of that right here now this feels a lot like 2022 back then we had huge
 capitulation style volume two bitcoin was tanking hard liquidations everywhere but what really amplified
 this sell side pressure was the collapse of ftx and celsius celsius froze withdrawals voyager and others
 went bankrupt that contagion caused cascading cells trust evaporated and we got the deep air bottom around 15 to 16k
 fast forward to now we're seeing similar panic selling and deleveraging with bitcoin down over 50 percent
 from its october 2025 peak around 126k dipping as low as 59.9 liquidations topped billions again
 etf outflows surging but here's the crucial difference no major exchange has blown up yet the ecosystem is more mature
 better regulation in spots like the us spot etfs providing real inflows even if outflows hit lately
 and institutional involvement is deeper the 2022 crash was fueled by opaque over leveraged centralized
 players failing today while risks exist we haven't seen that same black swan contagion yet if no big
 platforms go under in the coming weeks because the coming weeks will be the most important this could
 just be a healthy if brutal flush out not a repeat death spiral with that said one risk that's still
 bubbling under the surface the growing adoption of the bip 110 nodes for those not deep in the weeds bip 110 is a
 proposed temporary soft fork that limits arbitrary data in transactions at the consensus level think curbing
 spam like inscriptions large op returns brc20 junk stuff that's clogged the mempool and jacked up fees
 before node support has climbed to around 2.3 percent mostly via bitcoin knots software it's gaining traction fast
 among bitcoiners who want to prioritize bitcoin as sound money over data storage why does this matter in
 capitulation if adoption keeps rising and sparks debate or even activation pressure it could create network
 uncertainty forks community splits or spam related volatility in a stressed market like now any extra drama
 could amplify cells it's not the main driver today but it's a wild card worth watching more people running
 these nodes means that risk isn't gone levels that we're going to be focusing on so far we're bouncing
 from quarterly support it's going to be q2 of 2024's close you can also see that you did not smoke the q4
 2024 low so that is definitely going to be a very key level moving forward we have been watching the
 bitcoin exchange liquidation map this thing was already insane when it was just at 69 655 i had made
 posts about this insanity as the week was progressing even making a couple of little jokes about it because
 i've never seen levels like this since i've been watching this indicator i mean obviously it's bad
 when it can't even pull up the data it's so broken what do you think is this the capitulation bottom or
 is there more pain ahead drop your take in the comments smash the like if this helps subscribe for
 more breakdowns and turn on notifications so you don't miss the next move obviously we hit the weekly
 oversold level like i have been waiting for since this thing started as bitcoin at oversold levels has
 historically been the best place to be a buyer now that we're here i'm probably going to be waiting for
 some kind of diverging signal like we've seen over here honestly what i think is about to happen is a
 whole lot of sideways chop i think price is going to get much slower than it has been the last couple
 weeks you're probably going to see a lot of top side range liquidations as well as a lot of bottom side
 range liquidations that is if we can trade away from this low right now you have set the low but it
 is the weekend but as time goes on i would expect some sideways chop as price discovery sets back in
 make sure you guys trade safe out there make sure you trade smart and as always happy trading everybody
